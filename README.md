A 3D filament scale that uses RFID and an ESP32 to automatically generate an online database of all my filament spools on a google sheets document.
If you want to see it in action, check out my video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4BVC18xrVI 

For the real readme and a more in-depth explanation on how to build this yourself, check out the README.pdf inside this repo. Good luck!
